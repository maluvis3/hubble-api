          <p>The Hubble Space Telescope (often referred to as HST or Hubble) is a space telescope that was launched into
            low Earth orbit in 1990 and remains in operation. It was not the first space telescope but it is one of the
            largest and most versatile, well known both as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for
            astronomy.</p>

              <h2>Who is Edwin Hubble?</h2>
              <p>Edwin Powell Hubble (November 20, 1889 – September 28, 1953) was an American astronomer. He played a
                crucial role in establishing the fields of extragalactic astronomy and observational cosmology.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="panelTxt">
              <p>Hubble proved that many objects previously thought to be clouds of dust and gas and classified as
                "nebulae" were actually galaxies beyond the Milky Way. He used the strong direct relationship between a
                classical Cepheid variable's luminosity and pulsation period for scaling galactic and extragalactic
                distances.</p>
              <p>Hubble's name is most widely recognized for the Hubble Space Telescope, which was named in his honor,
                with a model prominently displayed in his hometown of Marshfield, Missouri.</p>
